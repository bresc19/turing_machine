 ###  :computer: A program simulator for  Non-Deterministic Turing-Machines  :computer:
The simulator was implemented with C-Language, for a project of Algorithms and Data Structure course, at Politecnico of Milan. Project also was valuated with pubblic and private test and graduated with highest mark.

### input file 
it's formed by:
- **List of Turing Machine's transitions**;
- **Final State(s)**: if a final state is reached, "1" will print, if not "0";
- **Max number of Stapes**: if a track croossed more than Max during computation, "U" would be printed;
- Strings that machine have to compute.

An *example* of input file with clear explaination is [Here](https://github.com/bresc19/turing_machine/blob/master/Info.pdf)
All *tests* used are [Here](https://github.com/bresc19/turing_machine/tree/master/Tests)
